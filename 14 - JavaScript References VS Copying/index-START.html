    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // let age = 10001;
    // let age2 = age;

    
    // console.log(age, age2);
    // age = 200;

    // // Value of age goes into the varibale at the same time.. we
    // console.log(age, age2);

    // let name = 'rob';
    // let name2 = name;

    // console.log(name, name2);

    // name='wesley';
    // console.log(name, name2)

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    const team = players;

   
    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // This will go back and update the reference, so it will reference to the original
    // value
    // team[3] = 'Lux';
    // console.log(players, team);

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    const team2 = Array.from(team);
    team2[3] = 'lux';

    // console.log(players, team2);

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players] // This will take every item out of our iterable and
                              // Put it into a containing array
    team4[3] = 'heeeee hawwww';

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy
    const captain = person; // if we change captain's number person will also be mutated
    captain.number = 99;

    console.log(person);

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
